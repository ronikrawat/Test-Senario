Test scenarios for Fan
1. Check the type of fan - whether the fan is ceiling fan or table fan
2. Verify the number of blades on the fan
3. Verify the ON-OFF functionality of fan
4. Verify if the fan works normally-throws wind on the right direction
5. Verify the material of which fan's blade and other parts are made
6. Check the voltage/power requirement of the fan
7. Verify the maximum speed of fan
8. Check the minimum speed of the fan
9. Verify that the speed of fan can be regulated using regulator
10. Verify that when in motion, the fan should not wobble
11. Check the length of the fan rod and blades
12. Verify that the weight of the fan is as per the specifications
13. Verify that the color of the fan is as per the specifications
14. Check the effect of voltage fluctuation on fan when in motion
15. Check the effect of sudden electricity outage on fan's motor and other electrical parts
16. Verify the fan's condition when continuously switched on for very large duration
17. Check if there is any life time of fan's internal parts or the body
18. Check if the blades of the fan can be bend or not, check if its material is brittle
19. Check the time taken by fan to attain maximum speed, when switched ON
